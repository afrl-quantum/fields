Installation Instructions
*************************

This project uses the Boost.Build system which automatically tracks
link, include, and other dependencies among any number of libraries and
projects.  These instructions assume that you have Boost.Build installed on your
system.

General Install:
  These instructions are for installing this software into a standard layout
  where libraries are installed to  <prefix>/lib
  and headers are installed to      <prefix>/include
  DEFAULT:  <prefix> = /usr/local

  For a simple install, just do:
  
      bjam install
  
  To change the installation path, use
  
      bjam --prefix=/path/to/install/into/ install
  
  For help on other options, execute
  
      bjam --help


Boost.Build:
  If you use Boost.Build, integrating this library into your own project is
  the most easy.  You simply, include a line like:

      use-project /fields : path/to/fields ;

  where the path/to/fields path can be either relative or absolute.  
  This library has several sub-libraries that are useful and which will
  invoke the proper linking to other libraries such as /physical//* and its
  dependencies.

      /fields//headers : only provides <include> dependencies
